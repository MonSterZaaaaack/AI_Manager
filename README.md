# AI_Manager
Creating an AI personality Manage tools in Unity
The AI_Behaviour_Controller system only contains files in "AIController" folder and "Editor" folder, 
the files in other folders ("Scripts","Prefabs", etc.) has nothing do to with the AI_Behaviour_Controller system, they are the revised version of the 3D game Kit project, 
we have modified them in order to work with the AI_behaviour Controller system.

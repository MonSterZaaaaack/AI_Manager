# AI_Manager
This is an AI Behaviour Manager tool in Unity
It gives a unique personality to each character in game to make players can not predict their response to certain events or stimuli in-game.
For more information about this system, please view the "Final Report". 
The AI_Behaviour_Controller system only contains files in "AIController" folder and "Editor" folder.
the files in other folders ("Scripts","Prefabs", etc.) have nothing do to with the AI_Behaviour_Controller system, they are the revised version of files from the 3D game Kit project, we have modified those files to work with the AI_behaviour Controller system for test uses.
